      "January is a month to review statistics from the prior year and to make predictions for the new year.  The automobile industry is no different.  In this post, we tackle a potpourri of trends to monitor in 2023, including new and used vehicle prices, electric vehicles, connected cars, and SAAR predictions.\n",
      "SAAR/Total Retail Units Sold\n",
      "As we reported in an earlier post this month, the December SAAR totaled just 13.77 million units.  Likewise, the total number of units retailed for the year has been estimated at 13,687,000, a decline of over a million units from a year ago.  Volumes were negatively impacted by the same conditions that affected manufacturer incentives—chip shortages and supply chain issues.  Despite the success achieved by auto dealers over the past two and half years, the total number of retail units sold has lagged behind the prior five-year average before COVID.\n",
      "Just as we wrote last year, some of the sales deficit may be offset or replaced by consumers who have either delayed their next purchase or shifted to purchasing a newer used vehicle rather than a new one.  In addition, demand in January 2023 is mitigated by inflation, rising interest rates, and fears of a recession that were not present a year ago.  Several industry experts have weighed in on their SAAR estimates for 2023:\n",
      "Edmunds – 14.8 million\n",
      "Cox Automotive – 14.1 million\n",
      "NADA – 14.6 million\n",
      "Toyota North America – 15 million\n",
      "It should be noted that these estimates for 2023 are tempered from last year’s estimates in the 15-16 million unit range.  Pricing trends will also impact new vehicle sales.\n",
      "New Vehicle Pricing Trends \n",
      "Mixed messages are coming from analysts regarding new vehicle pricing in 2023, with some (Edmunds) saying that pricing will cool while others still touting the highest average transaction prices month after month.  Can both be true, or the reality be somewhere in the middle?  First, let’s examine the terminology.  The metric often referenced in new vehicle pricing is MSRP or the manufacturer’s suggested retail price.  MSRP is a familiar metric, also known as the list price displayed on the window sticker, which also lists the vehicle’s model year, trim package level, EPA ratings, factory-installed options, and other information.  The law does not require dealers to sell vehicles at MSRP or list prices.  In the evolving world of transparency and more accessible information, consumers have historically been able to negotiate prices below MSRP, along with incentives offered by the manufacturer.\n",
      "While buyers have been able to negotiate successfully in the past, the roles have reversed in the last year and a half due to supply and demand conditions. But have they started to turn again?\n",
      "The average transaction price for new vehicles is another reported metric that consists of the average actual price of all new vehicles purchased.  It reflects the actual negotiated price with the consumer without incorporating any incentives from the manufacturer.  According to Edmunds, the average transaction price for new vehicles hit a record high of $47,681 in November 2022.  However, this same month ended a sixteen-month streak where the average transaction price topped MSRP.  Both trends have continued in December 2022 and are expected to carry on in 2023.  As our December 2022 SAAR blog commented, incentive spending returned above $1,000 for vehicles for the first time in many months.\n",
      "Through the middle of September 2022, these were the top 5 models selling over MSRP:\n",
      "These pricing trends have reversed for new vehicles, as fewer vehicles were sold above MSRP in December 2022.  According to J.D. Power, only 37% of all new vehicles were sold above MSRP, down from 50% in July 2022.\n",
      "Used Vehicle Pricing Trends\n",
      "According to Edmunds, the average price of a used car purchase in December 2022 was $29,533, down nearly $1,600 from the record high previously reached in April 2022.  For several reasons, used vehicle purchases and prices are more adversely affected by rising interest rates than new vehicles.  First, the auto loan rates on used vehicles are typically higher than the auto loan rates on new vehicles.  Second, buyers of used vehicles typically have less income than buyers of new cars.  If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates again in 2023, it will impact the overall affordability of vehicles in the entire automobile industry, particularly used vehicles.  The strain caused by rising interest rates and higher car payments will also make leasing a less viable option for consumers.  Edmunds reported that lease penetration fell to 17.4% in November 2022, compared to 28.3% in November 2019.\n",
      "Electric Vehicles (EVs)\n",
      "EVs dominated headlines in 2022 and will continue to experience increased adoption in 2023 due to government mandates and consumer preferences and behaviors.  In addition to the sheer number of EV vehicles on the roads, several EV trends are worth monitoring.\n",
      "EVs are becoming more attractive to historically luxury car owners.  According to data published by Edmunds, the percentage trade-in by luxury owners for three EV models (Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, and Kia EV6) is much higher than the percentage trade-in for the non-EV model, as seen in the table below:\n",
      "Perhaps this is a shift in the perception of luxury or the Tesla effect.  Instead of luxury being associated with historical brands and vehicle features, consumers view modifications in powertrain and in-vehicle technologies as synonymous with luxury.\n",
      "In addition to their popularity and increased adoption, EVs attract higher prices than their respective brand counterparts.  As we previously discussed, overall new vehicle prices have spiked over the last year and a half before cooling slightly in the last two months of the year.  EV prices for the same three models above trended higher, and in some cases much higher, than the average transaction price of their respective brands:\n",
      "Finally, data compiled by IHS Markit suggests that EVs may be attracting younger buyers.  Higher prices for EVs would generally suggest an older demographic.  However, the allure of change and the appeal of the environmental benefits have drawn in younger demographics.  Through the first nine months of 2022, 44.1% of all EV buyers were under the age of 45, compared to 35.5% of buyers from this age group for all new vehicles purchased.  In other words, younger consumers are purchasing more EVs, which could translate into more EV sales if those younger consumers permanently shift to EVs.\n",
      "Connected Cars\n",
      "Last year, we dedicated a blog to connected cars, including market size estimates.  According to data from Counterpoint, connected car penetration surpassed non-connected cars for the first time ever on a global scale in the second quarter of 2022.  The following table displays the global connected car market share of several manufacturers:\n",
      "Despite these market penetration figures, there is still plenty of growth in the connected car space.  What other connected car trends will we expect to see in 2023?  While it will still be many years (if ever) before we see full level 5 self-autonomous features, there will continue to be improvements in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).  Current features of ADAS consist of lidar, radar, and cameras that augment situational awareness.  The next evolution in ADAS will incorporate artificial intelligence to add more predictive and analytic insights.\n",
      "Connected cars will continue to have more and larger screens in 2023 as they evolve to emulate smartphones on wheels.  Consumers will also see more subscription services offered as manufacturers and third-party vendors seek to monetize infotainment and other features.  Some manufacturers have even begun to package seat warmers and other add-ons into subscription services.  Upgrades and maintenance of these features will continue to be managed by over-the-air updates (OTAs).\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "2022 proved to be another year where the auto industry successfully navigated challenges and achieved high profitability.  2023 will present new threats to consumer demand with the economic conditions.  If prices and margins decline further than the last several months, the tide may have finally stemmed the record profits from the previous two and half years.\n",

      "Automotive10 Automotive Industry Trends to Know in 2024min readJane Irene Kelly•May 21, 2024Browse Our Latest Reports & Interactive ContentThe Forrester Wave™: Real-Time Revenue Execution Platforms ReportThe State of AI in Digital Marketing ReportInvoca for Contact Center Success StoriesThe State of the Contact Center ReportshareThe recent pandemic threw a huge spanner in the works of the U.S. automotive industry. 2020 was one of the worst years on record for car sales as lockdowns kept people at home and supply chain disruption decimated dealership inventory. But today, automotive industry trends are, for the most part, on a more positive track. Understanding current trends with auto buyers is critical for manufacturers and dealers to develop winning automotive marketing strategies. With that in mind, we’ve identified 10 major automotive industry trends that are likely to have a significant impact on the marketing campaigns automakers develop and deploy in 2024.Rising Trends in the Automotive IndustryThe 10 trends we outline in this post suggest that the automotive industry is grappling with change on several fronts and trying to simultaneously manage multiple objectives, includingRecovering from years of disruptionAdapting to consumers’ changing needs and preferencesForging connections with new generations of car buyersPositioning for future growth and innovationDeveloping more sustainable productsLet’s dive into the list of top trends by discussing how lingering inventory issues for dealerships may finally be easing this year, and what that may mean for auto sales.Trend #1: A Return to Normal? (Almost.)Automotive marketing strategies in 2024 are already beginning to reflect a return to normalcy in auto purchasing. Inventory should soon reach pre-pandemic levels for many dealerships. That will allow them to provide immediate or prompt delivery to buyers rather than asking them to wait weeks or months to receive their vehicles.Prices rose with limited inventory but should stabilize and ease as more cars reach dealership forecourts. Car sales are projected to grow as a result, but won’t do so dramatically, despite solid demand. That’s because interest rates are at 23-year highs, creating credit issues for many buyers. However, this is an issue that manufacturers and dealers can overcome in many cases by offering compelling perks and discounts. Trend #2: The Slow But Steady Rise of EVsOne of the most significant auto market trends that has emerged in recent years is the focus on electric vehicles (EVs). Eco-friendly initiatives are a draw for future-forward manufacturers that no longer want to be associated with producing “gas guzzlers” (i.e., cars with poor fuel economy ratings) and aim to be at the forefront of change for their industry.All-electric manufacturer Tesla has witnessed a meteoric rise to dominate the EV space and the all-electric Hyundai IONIQ 6 was named car of the Year in 2023. However, despite generous federal buyer incentives for “Made in America” EV purchases, EV sales in the United States haven’t taken off as many predicted. Perhaps that’s why Tesla CEO Elon Musk insists that Tesla isn’t a car company?EV sales worldwide suggest a promising future is emerging for EVs, though. EVs represent one in every five cars sold globally, and demand is projected to surge over the next decade. However, in the U.S., only one in nine cars sold is an EV. But more widespread availability of public charging stations, longer-lasting batteries, and better pricing could help to fuel the growth of EV sales in the U.S. and elsewhere over time.Trend #3: Hybrid Is Having a Moment Hybrid vehicles are a logical step toward full electric — and for many consumers, it’s a more comfortable shift to make toward eco-friendly car-buying. The plug-in hybrid electric vehicle market is looking robust: It’s anticipated to be valued at nearly $36 billion this year.The world’s largest automaker, Toyota, is one company that has doubled down on producing gas-electric and plug-in hybrids rather than diving headlong into EV manufacturing. So far, its strategy is working. Toyota doubled its profits in the last nine months of 2023 and sales rose 20% in the first two months of this year largely on the back of hybrid sales. Toyota is also responding to consumers’ desire for choice by offering a broad range of hybrids from the Prius saloon to the Tundra truck.Trend #4: Marketing Budgets Poised to ExpandAutomotive marketing budgets have been tight lately, but the purse strings may loosen soon. Auto advertising trends suggest spending by car manufacturers and dealerships on digital ads will increase 11% in 2024.Regardless of resources, automotive marketing teams remain under pressure to justify their budgets. This makes tracking individual campaigns and the overall customer journey crucial. Without accurate attribution, how can marketing hope to defend their spend?According to research on automotive market trends, while most car sales today start online, more than 95% of purchases still happen at the dealership. Many consumers still prefer to call a dealership to get information on availability and pricing or arrange a test drive. Capturing attributable data from those calls can be a huge lift for marketing teams trying to prove return on advertising spend (ROAS) and also optimize their marketing spend.Call tracking and conversation intelligence software can bridge the information gap between customers’ online and offline journeys to create a complete and reliable picture of when, where, and why conversions take place. Invoca’s platform provides complete visibility into automotive marketing campaigns and creates a valuable database that marketers can use to optimize and defend their budgets.Trend #5: Digital Strategies Remain a MustOne automotive industry trend that deepened during the pandemic and continues today is consumers’ increased dependence on online research to shape their buying strategies. Automotive statistics suggest that 95% of consumers are bypassing visits to traditional dealerships in favor of conducting at least their initial research online.This is one key reason an effective automotive digital marketing strategy is so essential for reaching today’s consumers. Automotive industry trends indicate that new generations of car buyers, particularly Generation Z (considered to be the first generation of “digital natives”), make their purchasing decisions online or via a mobile phone. Hence the rise of virtual showrooms.The key to reaching these digital buyers is having the right data. (Carmakers like Volvo know the power of data when it comes to driving the right digital strategy.) The more meaningful data you can compile, the more informed your automotive marketing strategy can be.Using call tracking and conversation intelligence software can maximize your digital data stack by tracking, recording, and digitizing phone calls so that data points can be easily extracted from them. Invoca’s platform uses artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software to sift through data from every call into, or from, your marketing department or contact center to supplement online data and provide a complete picture for your digital strategy. Trend #6: Personalization Is a PriorityAnother way that data from online and offline interactions can move your automotive marketing strategy forward is by helping you to personalize car dealership marketing ideas, ads, sales pitches, and other customer contact. Personalization is a key automotive industry trend; it’s a way to build strong relationships with target audiences and develop a smooth omnichannel customer experience.Luxury brand Aston Martin might be the ultimate example of supercharging personalization in their marketing strategy. The British car manufacturer’s Q by Aston Martin is a bespoke customization service aimed at high-net-worth buyers. The brand has reinforced this personalized message to customers by opening a Q design center in New York City. In keeping with the brand’s exclusive image, the design center is open by appointment only.Your automotive business can accomplish personalization in many ways. One strategy is to use intelligent call routing technology like Invoca to create more seamless and personalized customer experiences through your contact center. Invoca’s conversation intelligence platform with PreSense can also alert the agent to who is calling and why they are calling, providing an opportunity to personalize conversations from the outset.Trend #7: The In-Car Experience Is Increasingly ConnectedCloud computing, mobile technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have transformed cars from siloed transport machines into capsules of connectivity and interactivity. Sensors are already used to activate parking assist in new car models and to enhance safety by alerting drivers if they are too close to the car they are following. More flexible data-driven systems are likely to be available soon.Connectivity can either be embedded in the car via computer chip technology or tethered by using interactive apps on a driver’s smartphone. This connectivity allows cars to do more than pick up the latest Taylor Swift album drop from your Apple Music app. They can now transmit data in real time to other vehicles to promote safety or provide traffic reports and to the cloud for real-time engine diagnostics.Trend #8: Influencers Are Becoming Even More … InfluentialAnother automotive market trend to watch in 2024 is the growing use of influencers for engaging target audiences. According to Digiday+Research, influencer marketing has become more widespread in marketing budgets. About 76% of marketing agency pros indicate that their clients spend at least a small portion of their budgets on influencer relationships.Cars.com uses influencer networks to syndicate its editorial content and get in front of its target audience through new and different channels. As this list of 10 top automotive influencers shows, influencers do have plenty of reach. Some are so sought-after that they work through influencer marketing agencies. Trend #9: Wooing Gen Z Is an ImperativeAutomotive marketers must always keep one eye on the future.  Buying patterns change with each generation. The last crop of baby boomers is in their 60s and maybe buying their last car. So, it’s time to think more about appealing to younger generations of car buyers — and, in particular, earning business from Gen Z consumers.Gen Z has the most buying power but may be the trickiest consumers to pin down. Though they grew up as digital natives and like to do their research online, they often prefer to do their buying in person. They also want to feel a connection to the brands they buy.South Korea’s Hyundai took a three-pronged marketing approach to snaring Gen Z eyeballs based on the premise of meeting them where they are. This involved investment in three of Gen Z’s favorite pastimes — movies, gaming, and K-Pop culture. Hyundai used its collaboration with Sony Pictures to project a futuristic brand image in the animated film “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.” The car manufacturer also partnered with gaming platform Roblox and the metaverse platform ZEPETO to showcase its brand and developed a brand video under the moniker “New Meets Old.”Trend #10: AI Emerging as a Go-To Tool for MarketersOur last trend in focus for 2024 is technological: Look for more marketers in the automotive industry, and beyond, to integrate AI into their marketing tech stack to transform how they work on many fronts.Generative AI tools, for example, can help marketing teams analyze huge digital data dumps quickly and efficiently. AI can also convert offline data such as phone calls into insights that help demonstrate the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and can lead to more sales. Invoca’s AI, for instance, can analyze phone conversations to determine if a caller is a lead for sales, what website activity drove them to all, what specific vehicle they’re calling about, and more.The use of AI-driven predictive analytics can also help automotive marketers to sort and assess data at tremendous speed and gain insights about consumer needs and expectations to help inform future campaigns. Other AI tools such as chatbots can provide hyper-personalized experiences for customers, supplementing “the human touch” in interactions.How Automakers Create Better Experiences and Drive More Revenue with InvocaIf you want to stay on top of the most compelling auto market trends, you need real insight into what your customers want and need.

      "Auto Industry In 2023:  The Trends that will Shape the Market\n",
      "The automotive industry is going through a period of radical change, especially now that consumers are quick to adopt the latest technologies that make their work easier. Trends shaping the automotive world in 2023 and beyond revolve around how cars are driven, powered, and shopped. Looking forward to 2023, the top trends will shape the auto industry.\n",
      "Increased Production of Electric Cars\n",
      "Technological advances will not stop anytime soon, and automakers are using this to their advantage. Innovative companies like Tesla and Google are working tirelessly to release self-driven and eclectic cars. More electric and technologically advanced vehicles will hit the market in 2023. Keep in mind there is intense competition to develop software and operating systems that will power these electric cars. Hence, there’s a lot to expect in terms of the technology vehicles will use in the coming months.\n",
      "A Surge in Digital Automobile Sales\n",
      "Since smartphones hit the markets, it’s evident that consumers are quick to adopt complex technologies that make their lives easier. Users are always looking for convenience and ease. These values have started shaping the automobile world and will continue to do so in 2023. Automakers have already begun to market the idea of shopping for cars without necessarily visiting car dealerships’ physical locations.\n",
      "With a device that connects to the internet, buyers can compare brands, check reviews, and take a 3D tour of their dream cars. There’s a good chance of an increase in digital automobile sales as buyers will want to take advantage of the online car marketplace. What’s more, some dealerships now offer home shipping deliveries at no cost to gain a competitive edge over others. So, expect more dealerships to jump on the bandwagon.\n",
      "Increased Sales of Used Cars\n",
      "The car industry is currently experiencing a rise in sales of used cars. The harsh economic times might be the reason for this trend. However, the boom in used car sales is because they are cheaper than new vehicles. As more people demand used cars, this trend will likely continue in 2023 and beyond. Low APR financing options have also influenced most buyers to purchase pre-owned cars.\n",
      "More Focus on the User\n",
      "In 2023, major transformations users will experience in the automotive industry will largely be influenced by the younger, tech-savvy folks. The younger generation often yearns to own a vehicle for flexibility, comfort, and status. Automakers will strive to meet the growing demand for cars that deliver what users need. Since millions of young people will want to adopt the latest technological innovations, the automotive industry will have no choice but to steer in this direction.\n",
      "Tracking Technology and Advanced Security\n",
      "Since there will be a rising trend of people looking to own cars, there will be a growing need to use tracking technology and other advanced security features. Car manufacturers are taking note of the rising demand for personal and vehicle safety. This means car owners will want advanced features to help protect themselves and their cars against theft, collisions, and accidents. Therefore, 2023 will likely have modern vehicles using sophisticated technologies to keep car owners safe.\n",
      "Self-Driving Cars\n",
      "The concept of self-driving (autonomous) vehicles is still something that people haven’t fully embraced. Nevertheless, we can’t overlook that advances in technology in 2023 will strive to make this concept a reality. Autonomous vehicles are expensive and, in some cases, unreliable, but anything can happen with technology. Who knew people would be charging their cars? So, the trend to push for reliable autonomous cars will continue in 2023.\n",
      "More Connected Cars\n",
      "Most trends shaping the auto world in 2023 revolve around advanced technology. This is the same case with the Internet of Things (IoT) and how cars will be more connected. Expect more connected cars in 2023, where car systems will integrate with other digital systems. Automakers will likely use predictive technology to maintain cars in the best condition while on the road.\n",
      "Wrapping Up\n",
      "The auto industry is evolving rapidly, especially with the latest tech trends people have to keep up with. 2023 will be an exciting year for car owners as they expect a lot of changes to improve their overall driving experience.\n",

Online advertising spend is expected to reach $23 million by 2025, expected to grow at CAGR of 16.2%. Combine these high stakes with the unique demands of each consumer, and you set a pretty high bar for growth. For automotive brands to succeed in this highly dynamic market, it’s crucial to identify and understand auto intenders at their core. By recognizing the specific needs, preferences, and aspirations of these consumer segments, automotive brands can tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer experiences to create more meaningful connections and drive growth. In this post, we delve deep into the world of automotive audiences, exploring the various consumer segments and shedding light on their characteristics, motivations, and behaviors. Keep reading for key strategies for automotive brands looking to target auto intenders plus unique insights on how to reach them.  4 Different Types of Automotive Audiences The first step to successfully targeting auto intenders is to understand the different types of audience segments and the groups that lie within them. Automotive audiences can be broken down into four different types of segments.  1. Demographic Segmentation 2. Psychographic Segmentation  3. Geographical Segmentation  4. Behavioral Segmentation  Let’s dive deeper into each type of market segmentation and the audiences within them.  1. Demographic Segmentation: Unveiling Auto Consumer Diversity  Demographic segmentation refers to the practice of dividing a target market into distinct groups based on various demographic factors such as age, gender, income, occupation, education, and family status. This segmentation strategy allows advertisers to tailor their marketing messages and campaigns to effectively reach and engage specific demographic groups within the larger automobile consumer market. Millennials: The Tech-Savvy Generation With the rise of digital technology, millennials have become a significant target audience for automotive brands. Born between 1981 and 1996, this tech-savvy generation values connectivity, sustainability, and convenience. They seek vehicles equipped with advanced infotainment systems, integrated mobile connectivity, and eco-friendly features. Furthermore, millennials often prioritize ride-sharing services and value the option of flexible ownership models. Here are a few helpful insights on millennial car buyers:  88% use the internet to research their car purchase. Millennials take longer than other generations to decide what car to buy, on average 16.9 weeks.  70% of younger millennials cite technology features as “must-haves” when purchasing a car.  Generation Z: The Next Wave of Consumers As the youngest consumer segment, Generation Z, born from the late 1990s to the early 2010s, represents the future of the automotive industry. This generation has grown up in a digital era, and is known for being constantly connected and mobile-centric. Interestingly enough though, despite their digital fluency, these auto intenders prefer to make their purchases at the dealership. In the car buying process, they also value comprehensiveness and transparency.  Insights to be mindful of when targeting auto intenders from this generation:  In a recent study, 81% of Gen Z consumers stated it was important to take their time to understand their options while buying a car.  87% of Gen Z buy their cars at a dealership, even if they may start their research online. More than any other demographic, Gen Z wants to work with a knowledgeable sales representative. 2. Psychographic Segmentation: Understanding Consumer Mindsets Psychographic segmentation involves dividing a target market into distinct groups based on psychological and lifestyle characteristics, attitudes, values, interests, and behaviors. This segmentation strategy focuses on understanding the motivations and aspirations of auto intenders to create advertising campaigns that align with their unique psychological profiles. Luxury Seekers: Elegance and Prestige For automotive brands operating in the luxury segment, targeting consumers who value elegance and prestige is paramount. Luxury seekers are willing to invest in high-end vehicles that reflect their status and taste. They appreciate exquisite craftsmanship, cutting-edge technology, and personalized experiences. By providing exceptional service and offering customization options, luxury brands can cater to this exclusive audience. Adventure Enthusiasts: Thrills and Exploration Adventure enthusiasts seek vehicles that enable them to embark on thrilling journeys and explore the world around them. Whether it’s rugged SUVs for off-road adventures or convertible sports cars for exhilarating road trips, this target audience craves excitement and versatility. Automotive brands can appeal to adventure enthusiasts by highlighting performance capabilities, robust designs, and innovative features that enhance the outdoor experience. Eco-Conscious Consumers: Sustainability Matters In an era of heightened environmental consciousness, automotive brands have an opportunity to target eco-conscious consumers. This audience segment prioritizes sustainability, fuel efficiency, and reduced carbon footprints. Hybrid and electric vehicles, powered by renewable energy sources, appeal to these consumers who seek to minimize their impact on the environment. By emphasizing environmental initiatives and investing in green technologies, automotive brands can capture this growing market. Family-Oriented Individuals: Safety and Practicality Families represent a significant target audience for automotive brands. Individuals with children prioritize safety, spaciousness, and practicality when choosing a vehicle. Family-oriented consumers seek features such as advanced safety technologies, ample cargo space, and rear-seat entertainment systems. By addressing the unique needs of families, automotive brands can build trust and loyalty among this demographic. Performance Enthusiasts: Speed and Power For automotive brands specializing in high-performance vehicles, targeting performance enthusiasts is vital. This audience segment seeks speed, power, and precision. They appreciate vehicles that deliver exhilarating driving experiences, refined engineering, and track-ready capabilities. By showcasing impressive performance metrics, advanced handling systems, and aerodynamic designs, brands can attract the attention of performance-driven consumers. 3. Geographical Segmentation: Addressing Local Preferences Geographical segmentation involves dividing a target market into distinct groups based on their geographic location or specific geographical factors. This segmentation strategy recognizes that consumer preferences, needs, and behaviors can vary based on where they live or the characteristics of their geographic location. Auto brands can utilize geographical segmentation to tailor their marketing efforts to specific regions, cities, or even neighborhoods, considering factors such as climate, terrain, infrastructure, and local transportation needs.  Urban Dwellers: Compact and Maneuverable Urban dwellers require vehicles that are suited to the challenges and demands of city life. Compact cars, electric vehicles, and hybrids are popular choices among this target audience due to their maneuverability, fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions. Additionally, urban consumers often prioritize connectivity features, parking assistance, and compact designs that enable easy navigation through crowded streets. Suburban Residents: Space and Versatility Suburban residents tend to prioritize spaciousness and versatility in their vehicle choices. They require vehicles capable of accommodating larger families, transporting cargo, and handling diverse road conditions. SUVs, minivans, and crossover vehicles appeal to this target audience due to their ample seating capacity, expansive cargo areas, and robust performance capabilities. Rural Communities: Ruggedness and Utility In rural areas, consumers often prioritize ruggedness, utility, and off-road capabilities. Whether it’s for agricultural purposes, outdoor activities, or traversing rough terrains, individuals living in rural communities require vehicles that can withstand challenging conditions. Pickup trucks, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), and four-wheel-drive SUVs are favored by this target audience due to their durability and versatility. Global Markets: Catering to Diverse Cultures Automotive brands with a global presence must adapt their strategies to cater to diverse cultures and preferences. Consumer behaviors and priorities vary significantly across different regions of the world. Whether it’s left-hand-drive vs. right-hand-drive markets, climatic considerations, or cultural preferences, understanding the nuances of each market is essential for automotive brands to effectively target their audiences. 4. Behavioral Segmentation: Uncovering Consumer Actions Behavioral segmentation involves dividing a target market into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, brand loyalty, usage patterns, and other behavioral factors. This segmentation strategy focuses on understanding how auto intenders make buying decisions based on their behaviors and preferences. Brand Loyalists: Cultivating Long-Term Relationships Building strong brand loyalty is crucial for automotive brands to thrive in a competitive market. Some consumers exhibit a strong preference for particular brands due to their past positive experiences, emotional connections, or perceived value. By consistently delivering high-quality products, exceptional customer service, and engaging marketing campaigns, automotive brands can cultivate long-term relationships with loyal customers. First-Time Buyers: Capturing New Opportunities First-time car buyers represent a unique target automotive audience that requires special attention from auto brands. These consumers are entering the market for the first time and often seek affordable options, financing assistance, and reliable vehicles. By offering entry-level models, attractive financing deals, and comprehensive customer support, brands can capture this segment and build brand loyalty from the start. Brand Switchers: Seizing Competitive Advantages Brand switchers are consumers who are open to exploring different automotive brands and switching their allegiance. These individuals may be dissatisfied with their current vehicles or seeking new features, technologies, or pricing structures. By understanding the factors that drive brand switching, automotive brands can tailor their marketing efforts and highlight their competitive advantages to attract these consumers. FAQs for Targeting the Right Automotive Audiences Q: What role does market research play in identifying auto intenders and target auto audiences for automotive brands?

Written by Jack Turner Updated on January 16, 2024 Our content is funded in part by commercial partnerships, at no extra cost to you and without impact to our editorial impartiality. Click to Learn More Technology affects almost every aspect of life in 2024, from transport efficiency and safety to access to food and healthcare, socialization, and productivity. It’s made learning more convenient, information easier to access, and has enabled global communities to form organically on the internet.Even though technology has impacted our lives positively and allowed ideas and resources to be shared more easily, the overuse of some technology has been linked to a decline in mental health, increased social division, and privacy concerns. The rapid rise of AI tools like ChatGPT has raised even more questions about the role technology plays in our lives.

Ways Technology Impacts Our Lives:Improved CommunicationAI Changing The Way We WorkDecreased PrivacyAccessible ShoppingBetter Information AccessVirtual Social LivesRemote Working4-Day Workweek 1. Improved Communication“Come here Watson, I need to see you.” These were the first words that Alexander Graham Bell uttered over his revolutionary invention back in 1876, and it’s fair to say that the trusty telephone has had a good run. Bell originally dreamed that there would be ‘one in every town’. He was right of course — in fact, these days, there’s one in every person’s pocket. However, technology has seen the traditional audio call being edged out in favor of messaging and social media as a way of touching base.Another medium that has seen a boom in the last few years is video calling. It’s nothing particularly new – the concept has been around for about as long as Bell’s telephone – but the revolution of high-speed broadband at affordable prices means that it’s now easy to send and receive the amounts of data needed for a video call.

You can unsubscribe at any time. While video calling has spent the last decade slowly creeping into daily life, it’s the ongoing pandemic that has pushed it over the edge and secured its future as an everyday way to stay in touch.Thanks to lockdowns and social distancing, families and friends are meeting up and socializing via video call more than ever before.If you hadn’t heard of Zoom before 2020, you will have certainly become aware of it by now, and while there are plenty of other video conferencing apps out there, it’s Zoom that has emerged as the poster child for video chat in the public consciousness. In 2023, it was estimated that Zoom had well over 800 million unique global visitors a month.In the post-pandemic world, more of us are working from home than ever. Many in-person meetings have been replaced with video conferencing as office staff swapping the boardroom for the bedroom (or wherever else they can find space to work at home) in droves. Now, based on data from mid-2022, Mckinsey estimates 35% of Americans can work from home full time.While Zoom is a great tool for catching up with buddies, can it do the job of supporting your business through the pandemic? We’ve evaluated several high-profile video conferencing systems and can help you find the right one for your company in minutes. 2. AI Changing The Way We WorkIf someone had told you just a few years ago that very soon, you’d have access to a free AI tool that could help you with all of your tasks, you might not have believed them. Millions of people now use ChatGPT, Bard, and other generative AI tools for all sorts of tasks in their personal and work lives.Although it was only launched back in November 2022, ChatGPT has already had a transformative impact on the lives of students and businesspeople alike, making their lives easier by quickly and accurately answering questions relating to their work. According to our own research, 65% of companies are using ChatGPT already.The AI revolution really is here. ChatGPT has been helping people with jobs like writing recipes, creating job resumes, crafting essays and poems, summarizing historical events, composing emails, creating spreadsheets, and even filing their tax returns. Others have used it to get free legal advice or plan their holiday. The ChatGPT website is currently generating around 1.8 billion visits a month, and a Tech.co survey found that almost half (47%) of business leaders are considering using AI instead of hiring new members of staff. Some experts even say that soon, large companies will have “50 different AI tools” in operation.Be mindful that although ChatGPT is useful and has already had a significant impact on the lives of millions of people, you can’t – and shouldn’t – use it for every single essay, report, or task in your day-to-day life.Although using ChatGPT isn’t technically plagiarism – after all, you’re not copying someone else’s work – many universities and schools now consider it to be cheating. Some teachers have said their students can use it, while others have banned it completely. It’s also not perfect, and it’s certainly not a geniue – AI tools often get things wrong, and you should always double-check the responses you receive from them. 3. Decreased PrivacyWe’re spending more of our lives online than ever before. According to one report, the “typical” global internet user spent seven hours a day online in 2022.Shopping? It’s done on Amazon. Catching up with friends? It’s FaceTime, Snapchat, or email. Want to be entertained? Netflix, or online gaming. Research? Hit up Google. Almost every facet of our daily routines can be catered for online today, so it seems inevitable that our time spent online will only increase. In fact, 37% of consumers said in a 2022 survey that they’d switched companies in an attempt to protect their own privacy.While access to everything online gives us an unparalleled level of convenience, it has also made us vulnerable. Every move we make online is recorded, and we leave digital footprints wherever we visit. Hackers and scammers know this, and work hard to exploit it for financial gain.Of course, as with everything else, technology has also given us the tools to protect ourselves and ensure that we are safe as our lives migrate online. In the last few years, this has become even more key – many of us are not only browsing for personal reasons, but accessing shared work networks from our own homes, and we can’t rely on the closed off security of the physical office. One piece of technology that will help keep your data safe is the password manager. A password manager will protect your existing passwords, suggest new and secure ones, and in some cases, even monitor the web to ensure that your details aren’t compromised. Not only that, but it will do away with that ever-present fear we all have of forgetting one of our many, many passwords. If you don’t have one, there’s never been a better time to invest –plus, with some of the best apps only costing a few dollars a month, it’s a great low-cost solution for added security.Another great security advancement is the Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN will bypass your internet service provider and mask your digital footprints. Nobody will be able to see the content you are accessing, and it makes you a lot less susceptible to hackers. You can also use public Wi-Fi accounts with more confidence. Many businesses have adopted them recently, as well as home users – they’re very quick to set up and most of the time you can troubleshoot a VPN yourself, which means they’re very low-maintenance.Our recommendation? PureVPN. It’s packed with features like quantum-resistant servers and a streaming “shortcuts” tool, and has servers in more than 60 countries. What’s more, at just $2.11 per month, it’s a lot cheaper than NordVPN and ExpressVPN.There’s also anti-virus software, providing a great shield from all the nasties out there on the internet looking to catch us out. This includes ransomware and malware, which is usually designed with the intent of extracting money from victims. From individuals to government, nobody is immune, and good antivirus software is a great way to capture and quarantine such efforts before they can wreak havoc.Lastly, there are different ways to remove your personal information from Google that, in a world of decreased privacy, are definitely worth knowing about. Knowing how to kick off Google’s official removal request process will come in handy, for example, if you find content on a website that includes sensitive data about you. Take Your Privacy Seriously A VPN can protect your identity from unwanted tracking. Have you used a VPN before? Yes No 4. Accessible ShoppingAs we’ve mentioned, shopping has found a convenient and popular home online, but that’s not to say the high street is to be ignored – after all, you can’t really beat seeing a product in the flesh before you buy it, and you can’t eat out online just yet (you can order a delivery, but that’s not quite the same).Technology hasn’t bypassed physical shopping either. Thanks to contactless cards and phone payments, we don’t need to worry about handing over cash or keying in a pin number – just tap to pay, and you’re done.If you’re a business, then a Point of Sale (POS) system is a huge boon, regardless of your size. With a POS, not only can you take payments electronically, but you can also automatically manage stock levels, create electronic receipts, manage loyalty schemes, manage sales and so on. It doesn’t need to be costly, either – POS systems start at around $30 a month, and some even offer free hardware. To find out more, take a look at our POS system reviews, and compare POS systems today. Of course, you don’t need to leave the house to shop. With the vast majority of us owning a tablet, laptop or smartphone, we’ve all got easy access to a virtual shop front right in front of us, where we can buy pretty much anything we want.Technology has also democratized retail. It used to be the case that you needed a physical presence to start your own shop – now all you need is a computer and an idea.Sharing your wares with the world is easier than ever. This is thanks to the simplicity of website builders – tools that can help you create professional-looking websites in minutes, then sell your products or services. Never Forget a Password Again Have you used a password manager before? Yes No 5. Better Information AccessToday, if you want to find something out, it’s no more strenuous than a couple of clicks. For many of us, we don’t even need to move from the spot – simply pull out your phone and get Googling, or even ask your smart home assistant.It may seem like a distant memory, but it wasn’t so long ago that you’d have to take a trip to the library to find out more in-depth information about a subject if it was available at all. Now, due to these advances in technology, you can find hundreds of thousands of web pages dedicated to pretty much anything you can dream of, from “crochet patterns” (Google gives 129,000,000 results) to “Roman history” (1,360,000,000 results). It’s something of a cliche, but there is literally an app for anything, and they’ve rendered a lot of other mediums all but obsolete for many of us. Take GPS, for example – if you want to know how to get somewhere, it’s simply a case of pulling up an app like Google Maps and choosing the best route, which will come complete with directions, as well as satellite imaging. There are even apps for businesses that automatically route vehicles alongside traffic, weather, safety and legal information. App technology has also made learning, dating, dining, and almost anything else you can think of a lot easier for us.Not to be overlooked either are the actual devices that all these apps run on. The rise of the smartphone has been exponential over the last decade, and daily web searches on mobile devicesnow outnumber those on laptop or desktop computers. Improvements continue to be made to handheld devices, each and every year, without fail.The mobile phone is now considered an essential device for almost everyone, vastly superseding its original use as a telephone (to actually talk to people) and becoming our pocket-sized portal to an online world. 6. Virtual Social LivesAnother seismic change in our lives over the past decade has been the widespread usage of social media. This industry has progressed fast, and the early days of the likes of MySpace and the original version of Facebook – which first went live in 2006 – seem like a bygone age already.Now, services such as Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, and others give us an insight into the waking lives of others in real-time, whether they’re friends with a few followers or celebrities with millions. New platforms are still coming out this year. Just recently, Meta – the company that owns WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram – brought out a new social media platform called Threads, which is a little bit like Twitter.Now, these very same companies want us to spend even more time online, in a digital space they call “the Metaverse”, a virtual reality where users can interact in a computer-generated environment. Facebook’s chief Mark Zuckerberg says he wants one billion people to exist within it one day, and a variety of metaverse companies now exist. In the past year, some businesses even managed to sell virtual land in the metaverse. Businesses have got in on the act too, and a savvy social media manager is considered essential in most companies, with their ability to make or break a brand’s reputation.Social media’s course over the last few years has been somewhat bumpy, but as a society, or many societies, we’ve never seen global communication on such a scale. It has enabled the rise of social commentary and movements, such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, as well as leaving us vulnerable, with the likes of Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal serving to manipulate voters and skew democracy.Social media can be fun, but studies have also shown that it can have a detrimental effect on our mental health. It’s so bad, in fact, that some governments are calling for social media companies to be more responsible – especially when it comes to younger users.A recent study in the UK found that 46% of young girls reported that social media had a negative impact on their self-esteem, so there’s clearly a lot to fix. Lots of other recent studies have found links between social media use and mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and even Smartphone addiction.Ultimately, social media is only as positive as the hands of the people it’s in – but it looks like it’s here to stay, whether you like it or not.As a consumer, you can choose to opt out, but businesses yet to get in on the action will soon fall behind the competition. Digital marketing is a hugely important aspect of any company with an online presence, and an essential one to get right. 7. Remote Working2020 will be remembered for a lot of negative reasons, but one of its most defining positives has been the widespread acceptance of working from home. With the pandemic in full swing, many had to abandon their offices and log on from their own residences.At its peak, 42% of Americans were working from home, according to one study. The trend has continued longer after the pandemic too, with large companies such as Twitter and Microsoft already stating that their staff can work from home indefinitely.The CIPD’s 2023 report on flexible working found that 40% of organizations reported an increase in requests for flexible working arrangements in 2023. Two-thirds (66%) of organizations said it was important to them to offer this perk when advertising for new roles, up from 56% in 2021.For many, working from home has been something of a revelation – no commuting, more flexible hours, a lessened environmental impact, and being able to choose where they work. All this is made possible thanks to technological advancements, yet again – as well as a whole host of companies offering remote work. That’s not to say working outside the office doesn’t have its challenges – organizing employees who are spread across various locations successfully can certainly present problems. But yet again, our friend technological progress comes to the rescue, this time with remote working software, which can aid in organization, time management, goal focus and structure.

Some US States are also pushing a 4-day workweek, too.The reason for the 4-day workweek becoming viable is, you guessed it, technology, specifically, AI. With the ability for tech to do a lot of the heavy lifting, many are arguing, including the likes of Bernie Sanders, that workers should reap the benefits and be rewarded with more leisure time.We have seen some landmark studies carried out on the reduced workweek over the last year, and they proved overwhelmingly positive for the most part.And why not? As we mention above, remote working, once seen as a luxury, is now more common than ever. The 4-day workweek could well be next. Conclusion: The Impact of TechnologySo, there we have it — eight dramatic ways that technology has impacted our daily lives for good. Of course, technology never takes a rest, and you can bet that it won’t be long before some of the devices and services we’ve covered here are superseded — in many cases, their next iteration is already being worked on in a lab somewhere.Regardless, there’s no denying that technology has, and will continue to, have a huge impact on our lives, in one way or another.More on this topic:Flirt, Fake, Make Them Wait— How Technology Has Changed the Way We InteractTop 6 Social Media Trends10 Ways Businesses Are Using ChatGPT Right NowHow to Remove Your Personal Information From GoogleWhat is a Digital Footprint, and How Do You Minimize It? How Technology Has Changed Our Lives: FAQs How has technology impacted society? Technology has impacted every aspect of society. It’s made learning, exercising, and shopping more entertaining and creative, our jobs more flexible, given us access to more information than we’ve ever had, and helped us connect with people on the other side of the world through social media. Technology has meant that we can travel further, work less and even exist in virtual realities. How has technology impacted people's activity levels? On the one hand, there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that young people in countries like America don’t exercise enough, and that technology like video games and television has led to us leading more sedentary, inactive lifestyles. However, technology has also led to improvements in sports training and helped us better understand what our bodies need to stay healthy. What are five positive effects of technology? Positive effects of technology include access to more information, a better understanding of the world around us, advances in medicine and life-saving treatment, less time spent working on mundane tasks, and new jobs being created. What are five negative effects of technology? Certain aspects of 21st-century technology have led to a myriad of negative effects, such as decreased privacy for almost everyone, higher levels of bullying, severe mental health issues, reduced sleep quality, and lower levels of physical activity.

      "Lots of people like the idea of having an electric vehicle as their daily driver --  at least in theory. Many still have qualms about range anxiety and how owning an EV will affect their daily routines. We’ve been talking to EV owners about these issues and have found plenty of compelling reasons to flip the EV switch!\n",
      "When asked why they considered buying an electric vehicle, most EV owners point to the environmental benefits - that driving electric means emitting zero tailpipe emissions.\n",
      "But once people dive into the EV lifestyle, they quickly point out other reasons for not missing their internal combustion cars.\n",
      "RICHARD HARTNETT: The biggest benefit I think is the extremely low cost of ownership, and of course, the side benefit that it’s extremely healthy to the environment. Because it’s not a gasoline powered vehicle, it’s not spewing any carbon emissions out into the air, which is good for all of us.\n",
      "JOYCE BREINER: Part of it was, reducing our emissions. We were on a track trying to reduce our household, our family emissions, and the other part was actually a little bit of a surprise, was they are so much fun.\n",
      "ALEXANDER YANEY: So, what I love about this car, is the acceleration. Zero to sixty in 4.2 seconds, which is better than any car I’ve had…\n",
      "We’ve got to give some credit to Tesla and their Ludicrous Mode for popularizing the notion that electric vehicles can be kick-ass performance cars, and other EV makers are following suit, but even the most basic EV can be fun to drive thanks to their electric motor’s instant-on torque curve.\n",
      "Sergeant Richard Hartnett of the Hyattsville Maryland Police liked his own Chevy Bolt so much, he lobbied to drive one at work too.\n",
      "RICHARD HARTNETT: One of the big advantages of the Bolt as a Police car, is that because there’s no transmission per se in an electric vehicle, when you step on the accelerator, the car just sorta takes right off..and that’s a little different than the gasoline-powered police cars, which have a little bit of sluggishness when they first take off. So, it’s very quick off the line, it’s had no problem keeping up with local chases, the few that we’ve had with it, and it’s very very quiet, so if i have to sorta sneak up on something that’s going on, the bad guys don’t know that I’m there.\n",
      "Currently, plug-in vehicle sales in the U.S. account for a very small percentage of all vehicles sold, but we’re starting to see a new generation of drivers for whom nothing else will do!\n",
      "I started driving on electric vehicles about 8 years ago. I took my driving test in a Nissan Leaf.\n",
      "And don’t forget, EV’s are not limited to four wheelers..\n",
      "VANESSA THOMAS: I rode motorcycles for a very long time, I grew up on motorcycles because my parents both ride. When I heard there was electric motorcycles out there, I was intrigued and wanted to find out more.. So I actually rode up to the closest place that had an electric motorcycle for sale, which was in New Jersey, which was a couple hundred miles from where I live, and rode one, and had a grin on my face from ear to ear all day long after that, and just knew i wanted one, so I’ve been riding electric ever since.\n",
      "Of course, the other big benefit of electric vehicles is lower cost of ownership and maintenance.\n",
      "VANESSA THOMAS: I really haven’t had much to fix on it so its been very low cost, very low maintenance.\n",
      "JOYCE BREINER: In a nutshell, EVs are so much less expensive to own or operate.\n",
      "It’s about 4 cents a mile to run an EV, and the maintenance is like non-existent you’re not worrying about going to, going to the shop for oil changes or anything like that. And they’ve pretty been maintenance free for us for the most part.\n",
      "The number of publicly accessible charging stations reached about 26,000 in 2020, offering over 83,500 outlets.\n",
      "But most owners we talked to say that bypassing the gas station and “fueling” at home is the greatest benefit of owning an EV. Plug in to a 110-volt outlet and virtually any electric vehicle can be fully charged overnight for a fraction of what a tank of gasoline or diesel would cost.\n",
      "VANESSA THOMAS: It costs a little over a dollar to charge up from zero to  full, so I can get you know 150 miles on a dollar.\n",
      "For those who’ve made the electric switch, it seems there’s no going back!\n",
      "JOYCE BREINER: EVs are fun, fun, fun to drive, and they’re easy, they’re safe, too. And I wouldn’t really want to be in anything else. \n",

      "Sustainable Endurance at Le Mans\n",
      "Episode 4407 \n",
      "The race to the checkered flag at the 24 Hours of Le Mans is one of the most difficult challenges in all of motorsports. The incredible merging of skill, effort, engineering, weather and luck needed to succeed there, is mind-boggling. But now, in a world ever-mindful of environmental impacts, these racers now face another enormous challenge.\n",
      "Every year in the month of June, the small town of Le Mans, France transforms into a motorsports mecca. For the 2024 edition, more than 239,000 race fans converged from all over the world, eager to cheer on their favorite teams. They stood 10-deep to watch the drivers parade through town. They flooded merchandise shops, clogged the fan zones and paddocks, filled the grandstands to capacity, and camped out to claim prime viewing spots along the 8-mile public road circuit. Through sun and rain and dark of night, this iconic 24-hour race is filled with high-speed drama, tragedy, strategy, and adrenaline. The sheer spectacle of it all is mesmerizing.\n",
      "Le Mans is the ultimate durability test for driver and machine, as both must perform at their best for an entire trip around the clock. But in the light of worldwide concern for the environment, that same clock is ticking for motorsports to clean up its act.\n",
      "Many outsiders view racing as a waste of resources, a frivolous pursuit of ego at the expense of eco. The old adage “win on Sunday, sell on Monday” still holds true, but the extreme conditions of competition have always served as a testing ground and accelerator for technological development, and that now includes sustainability. More than ever, that’s what drives car sales.\n",
      "In fact, wide-sweeping changes are taking place in all forms of motorsport. Race organizers here and around the world have set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030, with the aim of reducing race-related emissions by 30%. The World Endurance challenge series, which includes the 24 Hours of Le Mans, now runs on 100% renewable fuel. Known as Excellium Racing 100, this biofuel is derived from grape residue. Leave it to the French to run race cars on wine!\n",
      "Michelin has developed a tire composed of 71% biosourced materials, currently being tested on prototype race cars. The FIA sanctioning body issues three levels of sustainability accreditation, as a way for teams, suppliers and race venues to measure and enhance their environmental commitments.

      "May. 14, 2022 \n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10 min read\t\t\t\t\t\n",
      "Technology makes life easier and safer. It’s true that technology is altering our personal lives and the whole world in an almost infinite number of ways. Regardless, it is typical for people to criticize these accomplishments. Furthermore, news organizations enjoy speculating about the dangers of robotics. With all of this hostility, it’s easy to overlook the benefits of technology, such as the fact that the Internet wouldn’t even exist.\n",
      "As a result, taking a few minutes to acknowledge a few pieces of technology that simply make life more secure and a lot easier is a smart idea. Everything from identity theft to dangerous diseases would be considerably more common if these breakthroughs were not made.\n",
      "1. Better Healthcare Through Technology\n",
      "Technology and healthcare go together like jelly and peanut butter! In fact, technology has been changing healthcare so much that listing all of the excellent developments in just the last year would be difficult. Even if we simply focus on the latest tools such as a platform for managing clinical cases, it would still take a while for us to describe how essential technology has become in human services as a whole.\n",
      "However, the development of wearables and apps that allow people to track anything from their heart rate to their blood sugar levels is certainly one of the most important technological innovations in healthcare in the last decade. As a result, patients can now transmit data to their doctors remotely. Furthermore, they can keep a closer eye on their medical issues. There are still some challenges with processing all of this data. However, handling these easier is definitely on the horizon.\n",
      "2. More Secure Online Transactions Through Technology\n",
      "In an era where cybercrime is escalating, safeguarding online transactions has become crucial. Fortunately, advancements in technology are continually enhancing the security of online transactions, providing users with multiple layers of protection. Besides Apple Pay and PayPal, there are several other mechanisms and strategies that contribute to safer online shopping and financial dealings.\n",
      "Biometric Authentication: In addition to fingerprint verification offered by services like Apple Pay, other biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition and iris scanning, are being integrated into mobile devices and banking apps. These methods ensure that transactions are authorized only by the legitimate owner of the account, adding a personalized layer of security that is extremely difficult for fraudsters to bypass.\n",
      "Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This security process requires users to provide two different types of information before accessing their accounts or completing transactions. For example, you may need to enter a password and then verify your identity through a code sent to your phone. This method significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, as possessing the password alone is not enough to breach the account.\n",
      "Tokenization: This technology replaces sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, with unique identification symbols (tokens) that retain all the essential information without compromising security. Tokenization ensures that during the transaction process, actual credit card details are never exposed or transmitted, reducing the risk of data breaches.\n",
      "Encrypted Communication: Encryption is a method of converting information or data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communications on the internet. Websites that use SSL/TLS encryption (indicated by HTTPS in the URL) ensure that all data transmitted between your browser and the website’s server is encrypted and safe from eavesdroppers.\n",
      "Virtual Private Networks (VPN): Using a VPN while conducting online transactions can provide an additional layer of security, especially when connected to public Wi-Fi networks. VPNs encrypt your internet connection, making it difficult for hackers to intercept data, such as your credit card information or passwords.\n",
      "Regular Software Updates: Keeping your software, apps, and operating systems updated is vital for online security. Developers regularly release updates that patch vulnerabilities and enhance security features. By ensuring your devices are up-to-date, you reduce the risk of being targeted by malware or hackers exploiting outdated software.\n",
      "Educating Yourself About Phishing Scams: Awareness is a powerful tool against cybercrime. Phishing scams, where attackers attempt to trick you into giving away personal information, are common threats to online security. Educating yourself and others about how to recognize and avoid these scams is crucial for protecting your sensitive data.\n",
      "By leveraging these technologies and being vigilant, users can significantly enhance the security of their online transactions. As cyber threats evolve, so do the methods to counter them. Embracing these technological advancements not only helps in keeping your information safe but also ensures a smoother and more convenient online shopping experience.Related Stories from Baseline6 Ways to Elevate Your Office SpaceSmart Homes and Energy Bills: Does IoT Actually Save Money?Driving Ecommerce Success with SAP Hybris Development\n",
      "3. Easier Grocery Purchasing\n",
      "Streamlined Online Ordering\n",
      "Gone are the days when grocery shopping meant spending hours in crowded aisles. Now, numerous retailers have embraced online platforms, allowing customers to browse and select products from the comfort of their home. With the help of chatbot builders, these platforms have become even more user-friendly, offering personalized recommendations and instant support. This service is particularly advantageous for those with hectic schedules or mobility issues, as it removes the physical strain associated with traditional shopping.\n",
      "Benefits for Diverse Needs\n",
      "Online grocery shopping is not just a time-saver; it’s a lifeline for individuals with specific needs. Parents juggling work and childcare find it a boon. Moreover, it’s an essential service for individuals with autism, sensory processing disorders, or social anxieties, as it minimizes stressful stimuli. By catering to a wide array of personal needs, online grocery services ensure everyone has access to food and essentials without undue stress.\n",
      "Curbside Pickup – A Safe Alternative\n",
      "Retailers have taken convenience one step further with curbside pickup. This service eliminates the need to navigate crowded stores and long checkout lines. It’s particularly significant for personal safety – reducing exposure to potential threats in parking lots, a common concern for many shoppers. By staying in your vehicle while an employee loads your groceries, you maintain a safe environment, minimizing the risk of accidents or confrontations.\n",
      "Order Tracking and Reordering Simplified\n",
      "To enhance customer experience, stores like Kroger have integrated sophisticated tracking systems. These systems record each transaction, streamlining the reordering process. If you’re satisfied with a previous order, you can replicate it with just one click, saving time and effort. This feature is especially useful for routine purchases, making shopping more about efficiency and less about repetition.\n",

      "Environmental and Health Considerations\n",
      "Shopping online and opting for curbside pickup also align with environmental and health-conscious lifestyles. It reduces the carbon footprint associated with multiple individual trips to the store and minimizes contact, aligning with health guidelines, especially during flu seasons or pandemics.\n",
      "The evolution of grocery shopping into a digital, user-friendly experience reflects the broader trends of convenience and safety in our technology-driven world. By leveraging online purchasing and curbside pickup, individuals can enjoy a safer, more convenient, and personalized shopping experience, catering to a diverse range of lifestyles and needs. This advancement not only streamlines the mundane task of grocery shopping but also significantly contributes to the overall quality of life, demonstrating yet another way technology enhances our daily routines.\n",
      "4. Smart Cities\n",
      "Smart cities represent the pinnacle of urban development, blending technology with infrastructure to foster a sustainable, efficient, and more livable environment. These futuristic cities utilize a variety of advanced technologies, from IoT (Internet of Things) sensors to AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems, to improve public services, reduce waste, and streamline energy use. This integration targets not only enhancing the quality of urban life but also reducing the environmental footprint of cities.\n",
      "Resource Optimization and Environmental Impact\n",

Through innovative technologies, buildings and public spaces in smart cities monitor and control water and energy consumption, contributing to significant reductions in waste. The data collected helps in making informed decisions that align with environmental sustainability goals, ensuring that every aspect of urban living contributes to a healthier planet.\n",
      "Centralized Data for Informed Decision-Making\n",
      "Smart cities provide residents and authorities with centralized dashboards that display essential statistics on energy and resource consumption. This transparency not only holds buildings and individuals accountable but also empowers everyone to play an active role in achieving communal green objectives. By understanding their consumption patterns, residents can adjust their behaviors to be more eco-friendly, while city planners can identify areas for improvement and implement targeted strategies for conservation.\n",
      "Enhanced Quality of Life through Smart Infrastructure\n",
      "Beyond environmental benefits, smart cities enhance the overall quality of life for their residents. Smart transportation systems reduce traffic congestion and pollution, smart grids provide reliable and efficient energy distribution, and smart public services ensure that urban living is more convenient and accessible. These technological solutions create a seamless urban experience, where every service is optimized for efficiency and sustainability.\n",
      "Collaboration and Community Engagement\n",
      "Smart cities thrive on collaboration between government, businesses, and citizens. By involving the community in sustainability efforts and decision-making processes, these cities foster a sense of ownership and responsibility among residents. This collaborative approach ensures that the development and implementation of smart solutions are in tune with the needs and values of the community, leading to more effective and widely supported environmental initiatives.\n",
      "Smart cities are not just a vision of the future; they are a growing reality that showcases the potential of technology to revolutionize our urban landscapes. By harnessing the power of advanced technologies, smart cities address environmental challenges head-on while improving urban life. Whether it’s through reducing carbon footprints, enhancing resource efficiency, or fostering community engagement, smart cities represent a harmonious blend of innovation and sustainability, offering a promising path towards a greener and more connected world.\n",
      "5. Repurposing Through Internet Technology\n",
      "The Internet has revolutionized the way we view ownership and access to goods. With just a few clicks, it unveils a treasure trove of items that can be bought or rented in their pre-owned state. This digital marketplace not only presents an opportunity to save money but also plays a crucial role in environmental conservation. By facilitating the repurposing of goods, internet technology significantly reduces waste, keeping countless items out of landfills each year.\n",
      "A Thriving Marketplace for Used Goods\n",
      "Platforms like Freecycle, Craigslist, and many others have emerged as hubs for finding and distributing used goods. These websites offer a wide range of items, from household appliances and furniture to books and clothing, making it easier than ever to find exactly what you need at a fraction of the cost. The process is simple and accessible, encouraging more people to consider used items over new, thereby reducing the demand for resource-intensive manufacturing processes.\n",
      "Environmental Benefits of Online Repurposing\n",
      "The environmental impact of this trend is profound. Every item reused or repurposed means one less item requiring production, packaging, and shipping—all processes that contribute significantly to carbon emissions and resource depletion. Moreover, repurposing extends the life cycle of products, delaying their journey to the landfill and reducing the overall volume of waste. This not only conserves resources but also mitigates the environmental damage associated with waste management and disposal.\n",
      "Community Engagement and Economic Advantages\n",
      "Internet technology has fostered a sense of community among users who share, exchange, or sell pre-owned goods. This digital engagement promotes a culture of sustainability and mindfulness about consumption habits. It also highlights the economic benefits of repurposing, as individuals can save money on purchases while sellers or donors can declutter without discarding, ensuring that their items find a new life with someone who needs them.\n",
      "Educational and Creative Opportunities\n",
      "Beyond economic and environmental benefits, the online marketplace for used goods encourages learning and creativity. For instance, individuals can find affordable materials for DIY projects or educational resources like textbooks at a lower cost. This accessibility supports lifelong learning and creative exploration, underscoring the multifaceted value of repurposing through internet technology.\n",
      "Repurposing through internet technology represents a significant stride towards sustainability and responsible consumption. By making it easy and convenient to buy, sell, or donate used goods, the Internet plays a pivotal role in promoting environmental awareness and action. As more people embrace the practice of repurposing, we move closer to a circular economy where waste is minimized, and resources are used more efficiently. This evolution in how we acquire and dispose of goods highlights the transformative power of technology in fostering a greener, more sustainable world.\n",
      "6. Technology and Motivation\n",
      "Exercise may not be easy. However, doing it on a regular basis might help you have a more secure future by reducing your chances of developing devastating physical problems. Companies that are forward-thinking now understand the need to provide a strong fitness incentive to assist individuals in helping themselves.\n",
      "As a result, technology continues to develop innovative ways to provide individuals with this kind of assistance. The augmented reality game Pokemon Go is one of the most recent instances. The popular software incentivizes users to exercise. This leads to some people walking up to six kilometers each day in quest of Pokemon.\n",
      "7. Telecommuting Technology\n",
      "There are numerous advantages to working from home. These include lowering your carbon footprint and saving money on gasoline. In addition, it lowers your risk of being in an automotive accident.\n",
      "45 percent of U.S. employees can now telecommute at least part of the time. This is made pssible thanks to high-speed Internet, smartphones, laptops and project management software. No more commuting through rush hour traffic. No more arriving at work frustrated. Instead, these employees may enhance productivity, reduce stress, and work in their pajamas if they choose.\n",
      "8. Immediate Responses to all Questions Through Technology\n",
      "Everyone has gotten into an argument about whether or not something was true. These discussions might take a long time before the Internet. However, you can now look up anything on Google and receive quick results. This has made life much easier. In addition,  it’s a fantastic teaching tool for individuals of all ages.\n",
      "The time savings alone of discovering anything online is tremendous! However, don’t forget that you may build on the quick answers from the Internet by reading online books about the subject. In addition, podcasts and educational programs also contribute to the vast availability of knowledge of every kind.\n",
      "9. Technology: Bringing Families Together\n",
      "Skype, Email, Facetime, messaging, and social networking sites make it easy for people all over the world to stay in touch. People who use Facebook on a regular basis have a 10% boost in the intimacy of their relationships with friends and family, according to research. This serves to emphasize the ability of technology to bring people together. Family members from all across the world can participate in family gatherings via Skype. Additionally, sharing calendars aids in the avoidance of schedule issues amongst families.\n",
      "10. GPS Technology Makes Life Easier and Safer.\n",
      "We’ve all heard horror stories of people making poor driving decisions because of GPS instructions. However, these occurrences are far from common. Instead of glancing at a map, GPS gives us step-by-step voice directions to navigate. This makes it easier for every driver to keep their eyes on the road. In addition, this makes driving easier and safer by indicating which routes to avoid, when you’ll arrive, and the quickest route.\n",
      "This list only scratches the surface of the myriad ways that technology makes life easier and keeps us safer. This is precisely why these innovations are such game-changers.\n",
      "Wrapping Up\n",
      "In conclusion, technology shapes our world in many positive ways. It makes daily tasks easier and keeps us safer. From online shopping to better healthcare, technology’s benefits are clear. Yet, people often focus on the negatives. It’s important to remember the good it brings to our lives.\n",
      "For example, technology in healthcare saves lives every day. Online payments protect our information from theft. And smart cities help the environment. Plus, the internet keeps items out of landfills by making it easy to buy and sell used goods.\n",
      "Also, technology encourages us to move more and helps us work from home. It quickly answers our questions and connects us with family and friends around the world. And, GPS guides us safely to our destinations.\n",
      "Let’s not forget these benefits. Technology is here to help us, making our lives easier and safer. We should embrace it and use it to its full potential.\n",

      "Electric Vehicles in the Community: Benefits and Challenges\n",
      "By Michael Brower\n",
      "This blog is the second in a series exploring the topic of electric vehicles and equity. Read part 1 here.\n",
      "When environmental problems and disasters strike, they often hit disadvantaged communities the hardest.\n",
      "Whether it’s diesel fumes from aging school buses, or hurricanes causing massive flooding and power outages, communities that are home to predominantly low-income people and people of color often bear the brunt of the consequences.¹\n",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) for community use – including electric buses, vans, trucks, and ordinary passenger cars – represent an important opportunity for mitigating these problems. They can help lower the costs of delivering community services while reducing the exposure of children, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups to harmful air pollutants. With two-way charging, they can even help make electric power grids more resilient and protect against power outages, which can leave communities without access to health services, safe food, drinking water, medicines, and other essentials.\n",
      "This blog delves into the opportunities for EVs that are within reach for many communities and the economic, environmental, and public health benefits they can provide.\n",
      "Air Pollution and Public Health\n",
      "Surveys show that people from all walks of life care deeply about the effects of pollution, specifically air pollution, on their health and wellbeing. According to Gallup, for example, some 75% of Americans surveyed in 2018 report being concerned either a “great deal” or a “fair amount” by air pollution.2 Air pollution is typically viewed as more urgent and having a greater immediate impact on health and wellbeing than other issues such as climate change.\n",
      "Public concern reflects the reality that – although pollution levels have come down enormously in the decades since the Clean Air Act was passed in 1963 – air pollution still causes significant health problems. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), over 100 million Americans (nearly one in three) live in counties where the air quality fails to meet health standards.3 Studies show that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3), two especially harmful byproducts of combustion, cause some 100,000-200,000 premature deaths in the United States annually.4 About a quarter of these deaths are due to emissions from road vehicles. Air pollutants, most importantly PM2.5, are also responsible for millions of asthma attacks and other respiratory health complications every year and are implicated in delayed cognitive development and growth in children.5\n",
      "As bad as that sounds, the American Lung Association (ALA) observes that “the burden of air pollution is not evenly shared.”6 Lower income households and communities of color often experience greater exposure to air pollutants and, just as important, have fewer resources to address their health impacts. An EPA-funded study published in 2019 concluded that people of color, on average, are exposed to about 25% more fine particulate matter than Whites.7 Among Blacks, average exposure is 34% higher than for Whites. Nor do the averages tell the whole story. The research shows that people of color are over three times more likely to be exposed to the highest concentrations of harmful air pollutants than Whites.8\n",
      "The disparity in exposure is not primarily driven by income, as some might assume. As one of the co-authors of the EPA-funded study notes, “Because the data shows that the racial disparities hold for all income levels, our study reinforces previous findings that race/ethnicity, independently of income, drives air pollution-exposure disparities.” Compared to Whites, people of color tend to be more exposed to pollutants associated with industrial and urban activity. As another co-author stated, “The inequities we report are a result of systemic racism: Over time, people of color and pollution have been pushed together, not just in a few cases but for nearly all types of emissions.”9 (See Figure 1).\n",
      "Figure 1. Results of an EPA-funded study by researchers at several universities, which estimated the relative exposure to PM2.5 of people in 5 groupings: White, People of Color, Black, Hispanic, and Asian. The charts show the proportion of members of each group exposed to above-average (red bars) or below-average (blue bars) concentrations of pollutants both in absolute (charts A-E) and relative (charts F-J) terms. Source: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abf4491\n",
      "While road vehicles are not the only source of harmful air pollution – industry, coal-fired power generation, and construction make important contributions – they are one source of pollution that communities can take direct action to address. Lacking tailpipes, electric vehicles – including school buses, vans, and passenger vehicles – directly eliminate harmful pollutant emissions including particulates, ozone, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. In the transportation sector, replacing diesel trucks and buses with EVs presents probably the biggest single opportunity for reducing pollutant exposures in communities, for they produce far more fine particulates than do gasoline vehicles.\n",
      "Cost Savings\n",
      "Besides addressing an important public health hazard, electric vehicles can help communities meet their budget challenges. They can lower vehicle fueling costs by half, or more, thanks to their higher efficiency and the lower cost of electricity per unit of energy delivered compared to gasoline or diesel fuel. Counting all operating expenses including insurance, tires, registration, and maintenance, they are typically 25% less expensive to run than their conventional equivalents. See Table 1 for a comparison of two vehicle types with gasoline and EV versions: the Ford F-150 pickup and the Hyundai Kona.\n",
      "Table 1 . Comparison of fuel and operating costs of EV and gasoline versions of two leading vehicle models. Source: US DOE Alternative Fuels Data Center calculator (https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/, accessed February 10, 2023). Assumptions: Gasoline $3.86/gallon (national average price for mid-grade gasoline as of February 10, 2023, according to the American Automobile Association). Electricity $0.195/kWh (based on New York State prices). Annual miles driven: 12,000 (5316 city, 6684 highway).\n",
      "The upfront costs for EVs tend to be higher than for conventional vehicles, but the total cost of ownership is generally similar, and the greater the annual and cumulative mileage, the more the cost comparison favors EVs. For the vehicles shown in Figure 2, the Hyundai Kona EV is more expensive to own than the conventional Kona over the first 12 years, after that becoming less expensive, whereas the F-150 Lightning is less expensive to own than the conventional F-150 over nearly the entire life of the vehicles. These comparisons assume no incentives, such as tax credits or grants, to reduce the purchase cost. Where such incentives are available, EV ownership can be very attractive indeed.\n",
      "Figure 2. Cumulative total cost of ownership over 15 years for the same four vehicles shown in Table 1. The purchase price of each vehicle is assumed to be financed over 5 years with 10% down payment. The chart assumes no tax credits or other incentives for EV ownership . For source, see Table 1. Source: US DOE Alternative Fuels Data Center calculator (https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/, accessed February 10, 2023).\n",
      "EVs can create opportunities for additional operating cost savings when recharged with cheaper power, which is often available at night when most community-serving vehicles are not being used. Under some utility rate programs, the power stored in EV batteries can be sold back to the grid when not needed if the vehicles are equipped with two-way “vehicle-to-grid” (V2G) charging systems. School buses and other community vehicles have daily use profiles that are well suited to such “peak-saving” strategies, which increase the reliability of the grid and lower electricity costs for all community members.\n",
      "Transitioning to EVs: Progress and Challenges\n",
      "Like many consumers, communities are waking up to the potential opportunities offered by EVs for addressing their public health and economic needs. Two important strategies are, first, encouraging the adoption of EVs by community residents and businesses, and second, transitioning community-owned vehicle fleets to EVs. Unfortunately, progress towards adoption of EVs at the community level is slow and uneven due to a variety of challenges and barriers.\n",
      "Nowhere are the advantages of EVs and the opportunities for community adoption more attractive than with electric school buses. They have become the focal point for a nationwide push led by the US EPA and other state, federal, and local agencies, which is now reaching hundreds of school districts.\n",
      "The public health case for electric school buses is strong. Every school day, we expose some 20 million children to harmful fumes from school buses. A study by the Natural Resources Defense Council highlights the following finding:\n",
      "We estimate that for every one million children riding the school bus for 1 or 2 hours each day during the school year, 23 to 46 children may eventually develop cancer from the excess diesel exhaust they inhale on their way to and from school. This means a child riding a school bus is being exposed to as much as 46 times the cancer risk considered “significant” by EPA and under federal law.10\n",
      "Most school buses run on diesel fuel, and the particulate matter emitted from their tailpipes (which can accumulate inside the buses) is believed likely to affect brain development and contribute to asthma and other ailments that take children out of school.11 Sadly, the very means many children use to get to school may affect their ability to thrive there.\n",
      "According to the World Resource Institute’s (WRI’s) Electric School Bus Initiative, over 400 school districts have committed to deploying at least one electric school bus.12 This represents only 2% of all 19,954 districts in the WRI database, and the number of electric buses so far committed – over 12,000 – is likewise small compared to the 500,000 school buses across the United States. Still, it’s a substantial development, and one that should accelerate as the cost of electric school buses declines, more funding becomes available to offset the cost of purchase, and their benefits for student and community health and district operating budgets become more widely known.\n",
      "The Stockton (California) Unified School District (SUSD) is a leading example of how districts serving disadvantaged communities can embrace electric vehicles to address health problems among their student populations. Some 78% of the SUSD population is classified as low income, and 80% are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. The students are about 80% non-white (including Latinx). As in many lower-income populations, exposure to pollutants in Stockton is high, as is the incidence of associated health problems. According to the California State Government, Stockton residents are in the 96th percentile for exposure to particulate matter in the air. At the same time, the city is in the 100th percentile for incidence of asthma.13 Air quality is a clearly vital concern for the city.\n",
      "Consequently, both the state and city have made it a priority to reduce the pollution burden on Stockton residents, and especially their children. The district has already deployed 11 electric buses on school routes, representing 12% of its fleet of 90 buses, and a total of 24 are planned in the initial phase of the program. Funding to pay for the buses and the charging stations they will need – a total of $8.3 million – has come from a wide variety of sources, including the California Air Resources Board, California Energy Commission, San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District, and Pacific Gas & Electric, among others.\n",
      "Such funding is essential, since full-size electric school buses, which are still manufactured in small numbers, presently cost around $350,000-$400,000 each, roughly twice their diesel equivalents. Despite an annual savings of $5,000-$10,000 in fuel and maintenance costs, incentives are needed to make their purchase affordable and accessible to all communities.14 Some states are rising to the challenge. For example, the California Energy Commission created the School Bus Replacement program to subsidize the replacement of aging diesel buses with new electric buses. In New Jersey, school districts receive support for bus electrification from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a carbon-allowance trading program. Funds from the Volkswagen “Dieselgate” settlement can also be used to subsidize community electric vehicle initiatives.\n",
      "Beyond school buses, towns and cities are moving to embrace electric vehicles. New York City has committed to creating a green transportation system for its residents, notably including:\n",
      "• 100% electric city fleet by 2040• 100% electric school bus fleet by 2035• 1,000 curbside chargers by 2025, increasing to 10,000 by 2030• 6,000 publicly accessible fast chargers by 2030\n",
      "Other communities are moving in a similar direction.16 For example, Sacramento, California, is making shared electric cars available to the public, along with zero-emission buses and an on-demand electric van. Indianapolis, Indiana created an electric bus line, the IndyGo Red Line, connecting underserved parts of the city to high-employment areas.17 Los Angeles, California plans to convert its entire fleet of transit buses to electric buses by 2030, part of a broad package of sustainability measures.18\n",
      "In subsequent blogs in this series, we will look at a new application of community EVs made possible by vehicle-to-grid technology and how it can improve resilience in the face of natural disasters and address specific policy initiatives that are needed to accelerate the deployment of EVs.\n",
