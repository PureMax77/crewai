   - 1 teaspoon lemon juice

**Preparation Instructions:**

1. **Vegetarian Moussaka:**
   - Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Slice the eggplants into 1/4-inch rounds, sprinkle with salt and let them sit for 20 minutes. Rinse and pat dry.
   - In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat and fry the eggplant slices until golden. Remove and set aside.
   - In the same skillet, add onions and garlic, sauté until translucent. Add cooked lentils, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, cinnamon, oregano, allspice, salt, pepper, and vegetable broth. Simmer for 15 minutes.
   - For the béchamel sauce, melt butter in a saucepan, add flour, and cook for 1 minute. Gradually whisk in milk, cooking until thickened. Remove from heat, add egg yolks or chickpea mixture, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
   - In a baking dish, layer half of the eggplant, then the lentil mixture, the remaining eggplant, and top with béchamel sauce. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese or nutritional yeast on top.
   - Bake for 45 minutes until golden brown.

2. **Greek Salad:**
   - In a large bowl, combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, green pepper, olives, and feta.
   - In a small bowl, whisk together olive oil, vinegar, oregano, salt, and pepper. Pour over the salad and toss to combine.

3. **Baklava:**
   - Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 10 sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with butter.
   - Mix walnuts and cinnamon. Sprinkle a layer of the nut mixture over the phyllo.
   - Layer 5 sheets of phyllo, butter each, and sprinkle with nuts. Repeat until all ingredients are used, ending with 10 sheets of phyllo.
   - Cut into diamond shapes with a sharp knife. Bake for 50 minutes or until golden.
   - In a saucepan, combine sugar, water, honey or agave syrup, vanilla, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 10 minutes. Pour over baked baklava.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Serve the vegetarian moussaka hot, directly from the oven, with a side of fresh Greek salad.
- Cut the baklava into pieces and serve as a delightful, sweet ending to the meal.
- Pair with a Greek red wine such as Agiorgitiko for the main course, and a dessert wine like Muscat for the baklava.

**Explanation of Replaced Ingredients:**

- The ground lamb or beef in the moussaka is replaced with cooked lentils to maintain a hearty texture and provide plant-based protein.
- The red wine is substituted with vegetable broth to keep it alcohol-free, which also deepens the flavor profile.
- Parmesan cheese can be swapped with nutritional yeast for a vegan alternative, maintaining the cheesy flavor.
- In the béchamel sauce, egg yolks can be replaced with chickpea flour and water for a vegan option, providing a similar thickening effect.
- Feta cheese in the Greek salad can be replaced with vegan feta to accommodate dietary preferences.
- Honey in the baklava can be substituted with agave syrup for a vegan sweetener option.
